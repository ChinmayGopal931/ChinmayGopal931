- 🔮 **Wagerly** a **permissionless predictions market** built entirely on **HyperEVM** [Wagerly](https://wagerly-markets.vercel.app/)
- 🐝 Exploring **CCM on Solana** with [PyroDotBuzz](https://pyro.buzz)
- 🏗️ Exploring AMM designs with a  **auctions Managed AMM** on **Uniswap v4** [amAMM](https://github.com/Uniswap-Hook-Incubation-1st-Cohort-2024/am-amm)
